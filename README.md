# CurseForge Localizations

A small script to manage localization strings for World of Warcraft AddOns when using [CurseForge's localization feature](https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000197356-project-localization).

It will (recursively) scan Lua files for text matching the [AceLocale](https://www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/api/ace-locale-3-0) format (e.g. `L["An example"]`), then upload them to CurseForge. In essence it'll keep the strings used in the project code in-sync with CurseForge. It's a perfect companion to [localization substitution](https://github.com/BigWigsMods/packager/wiki/Localization-Substitution) in packagers.

> Using AceLocale in your project is not required, the structure it defines has become the default that many libraries/addons use, and AceLocale is the most common way to use it.

The script uses the [CurseForge Upload API](https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000197321-curseforge-api), which requires authentication (see below).

## Usage

```
usage: update.py [-k KEY] [-i ID] [-l OPT] [-m OPT] [-n OPT] [-h]

required arguments::
  -k, --key KEY        API key or path to file that contains the key for CurseForge,
                       can also be defined as CF_API_KEY environment variable
  -i, --id ID          project ID on CurseForge

optional arguments::
  -l, --lang OPT       base language of strings (default = enUS)
  -m, --missing OPT    how to handle missing phrases (default = DoNothing)
  -n, --namespace OPT  namespace to upload to
  -h, --help           show this help message
```

For the tool to work correctly (i.e. upload strings) it needs at minimum two pieces of information:

- it needs the API key to talk to the CurseForge API
  - you can generate one here: <https://authors-old.curseforge.com/account/api-tokens>
  - the script can read this from a file, an environment variable, or as a plain string argument
- it needs the project ID on CurseForge
  - see the right column of your project's webpage on CurseForge
  - if this is not provided as an argument the script will attempt to find it from the `X-Curse-Project-ID` field in nearby TOC files, as it's commonly used/defined that was by other tools

And you obviously need to enable the Localization feature on CurseForge for your project;

The additional options should be pretty straight-forward, although some are quite advanced.  
Please refer to the CurseForge support article for some of them.

## Example workflow

The script can be used as an [action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) in a GitHub [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/about-workflows);

```yaml
name: Upload localization strings to CurseForge

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
    tags-ignore:
      - '**'

jobs:
  upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Clone project
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Upload localizations
        uses: p3lim/curseforge-localizations@v1
        with:
          handle_missing: DeletePhrase # optional
        env:
          CF_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CF_API_KEY }}
```
